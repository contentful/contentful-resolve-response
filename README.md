# contentful-resolve-response

Suppose you have a Contentful query's response JSON. The links are
nice, but what we really usually need is the response with a resolved
object graph.

`contentful-resolve-response` does just that:

``` js
var resolveResponse = require('contentful-resolve-response');

var response = {
  items: [
    {
      someValue: 'wow',
      someLink: { sys: { type: 'Link', linkType: 'Entry', id: 'suchId' } }
    }
  ],
  includes: {
    Entry: [
      { sys: { type: 'Entry', id: 'suchId' }, very: 'doge' }
    ]
  }
};

var items = resolveResponse(response)
// Responds with the original object in the first position and mutated object in the second.

console.log(items);

// produces:
[
    {
      items: [
        {
          someValue: 'wow',
          someLink: { sys: { type: 'Link', linkType: 'Entry', id: 'suchId' } }
        }
      ],
      includes: {
        Entry: [
          { sys: { type: 'Entry', id: 'suchId' }, very: 'doge' }
        ]
      }
    },
    [
      {
        // Value stays the same
        someValue: 'wow',
        
        // Link gets replaced by the actual object from `includes.Entry`
        someLink: {sys: {type: 'Entry', id: 'suchId'}, very: 'doge'}
      }
    ]
  ];
    
]
```

Note that:

- The original object passed in will be mutated (Boo! PRs welcome!)
- Multiple links to the same resource will point to the same object
- Circular references are possible
